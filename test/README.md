# Testing for Build Your Own Redis

## How to Run Tests

Run all tests using:

```
npm test
```

(Currently, this is a placeholder. Add test files in this directory and update the test script in package.json as needed.)

## Adding New Tests

- Place your test files in this directory.
- Use a testing framework such as Mocha, Jest, or Node's built-in assert module.
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request.

## Guidelines

- Write clear, descriptive test cases.
- Cover both typical and edge cases for each command or feature.
- Update this documentation as the testing approach evolves.
