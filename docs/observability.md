# Observability Guide

Observability is crucial for understanding, debugging, and maintaining your Redis clone. This guide provides suggestions for adding observability to your project.

## Logging

- Use `console.log` for basic logging of connections, commands, and errors.
- For more advanced logging, consider using a logging library like `winston` or `pino`.
- Log the following events:
  - New client connections and disconnections
  - Received commands and their arguments
  - Errors and exceptions

## Metrics

- Track metrics such as:
  - Number of active connections
  - Number of commands processed
  - Command execution time
- You can use libraries like `prom-client` to expose metrics in Prometheus format.

## Tracing

- For distributed tracing, consider using OpenTelemetry or similar tools.
- Trace the flow of a command from reception to response.

## Example: Basic Logging

```js
server.on('connection', (connection) => {
  console.log('New client connected');
  connection.on('end', () => {
    console.log('Client disconnected');
  });
});
```

## Next Steps

- Start with basic logging, then add metrics and tracing as the project grows.
- Document any observability features you add in this file.
